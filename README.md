My attempt to solve [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) using [F#](https://fsharp.org/) in order to better learn the language. I don't have much experience with functional programming languages, so this is my attempt to get a better feel for the paradigm.

F# does allow for mutability and loops, but it's not "idiomatic," so I opt against using these features, relying mostly on recursion and pattern matching.

The code in this repository targets Mono, not the modern .NET version of F#, but it should be compatible.
